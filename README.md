# House Sales Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for analyzing house sales data. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling techniques to understand trends and patterns in housing prices.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature engineering, and data transformations.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes key insights, trends, and correlations in the dataset.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implements machine learning models to predict house prices.
- **Results and Insights**: Summarizes findings and actionable insights derived from the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about house sales, including features such as:

- **Date**: Date of the sale.
- **Price**: Sale price of the house.
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms.
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms.
- **Square Footage**: Living area, lot area, etc.
- **Location Features**: Zip code, latitude, and longitude.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc.

## Visualizations

The notebook includes the following visualizations:

- Price distributions
- Correlation heatmaps
- Feature importance (if using machine learning models)
- Scatter plots for key features

## Results

- Key factors influencing house prices.
- Predictions for unseen data using trained models.
- Insights into trends and patterns in the housing market.
